%% 
% * Coordinates are described as normalized 4D-vectors.
% * Directional Vectors in the curved 3D Hypersphere surface are described as 
% two 4D coordinate vectors.
% * Orientation of an object is discribed as three 4D-vectors that always all 
% need to be orthogonal to the current 4D-coordinate vector.
% * Lateral translation is described as directional Vector (two 4D-coordinate-vectors) 
% and an angle. The coordinate of the object will then be rotated in 4D space 
% around the plane that is orthogonal to the two 4D-coordinate-vectors (the directional 
% vector) with the amount of the given angle. Important is to also rotate the 
% orientation of this object while translating. The three 4D-orientation-vectors 
% will be multiplied with the same rotation matrix as the 4D-coordinate vector.
% * Local directional vectors at a point can be calculated by finding the plane 
% that is orthogonal to the two point of a curved-directional-vector. The 4D-vector 
% that is orthogonal to that plane and the 4D-coordinate-vector of the point (can 
% be calculated by the 4D-crossproduct) is the local directional vector.
% * Angle to up- and right-angle of camera to object can be calculated by: Find 
% the local-directional-vector at the camera point to the object point. Then project 
% the local-direction-vector on each three of the camera orientation vectors. 
% This way it is possible to calculate the angle between the camera view direction 
% and and the local-direction-vector regarding the vertical and horizontal viewport.
% * 3D models are represented as a classic set of 3D vectors thet describe the 
% triangle vertecies.
% * Given a 4D-coordinate-vector position and a 4D orientation of an object 
% and a 3D-model-vertex the 4D position of this vertex can be calculated the following 
% way: add a new fourth dimension to the vertex and set this new value to 0. Create 
% a 4D matrix that has the three 4D-orientation-vectors of that object as first 
% three columns and the 4D-coordinate-vector in the fourth column, all these four 
% vectors need to be normalized.
